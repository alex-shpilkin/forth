An unnamed Forth project for the STM8
=====================================

The C compilers for the STM8 are rather bad, and no wonder, given that it
is essentially an old-style accumulator architecture completely unsuitable
for modern register allocators.  I was asked by one of my friends to
to review the situation and thought it would be interesting to change the
problem and implement a (tethered) Forth for it.  This is the record of
that effort, but it might also end up bringing together other related
pieces of code I have lying around.  I currently assume an STM8S-DISCOVERY
board whenever necessary, the generalization will come later.
